UI suggestions (prioritized)

Move primary actions to a bottom FAB or bottom nav

Rationale: thumb reachability on iPhone is better at the bottom.
Hint: add a fixed bottom bar with Add Entry / Catch Conditions / Export buttons in index.html.
Compact "Quick Log" mode (single-row card)

Rationale: minimize taps while fishing — time, platform, species, depth, GPS, photo.
Hint: collapse advanced grids into a single compact form and surface full form with a “More” link.
Prominent Save / Sync indicator

Rationale: let users know data is saved locally and whether a remote push succeeded.
Hint: small status pill near header (Saved • Pushed at 12:34), update after save/push.
One-tap camera capture with preview overlay

Rationale: photo is important; minimize friction capturing and confirming a shot.
Hint: reuse #photoInput but show a full-screen camera overlay on iOS Safari via CSS modal.
Inline validation + subtle haptics cue

Rationale: quick correction without modal alerts; haptics on iPhone for missing required fields.
Hint: highlight invalid fields and show compact toast; optionally call navigator.vibrate().
Condensed entries list (compact rows + swipe actions)

Rationale: more entries visible; swipe left = delete, right = duplicate/edit.
Hint: change table rows to card-like list with touch handlers.
Station/Conditions quick panel

Rationale: at dock, single tap to fetch station + populate header; show source/timestamp inline.
Hint: turn #marineSource into a collapsible panel with “Apply / Undo”.
Show TripID and pushed status in header

Rationale: traceability if you push full-trip to Sheets.
Hint: add small badge in Trip header populated after push.
Undo & history affordances

Rationale: mistakes happen on the boat; make undo immediate, not hidden in toast.
Hint: persistent small “Undo” icon near the toast that expands into a short action list.
Improve contrast & touch sizes for critical inputs

Rationale: glare and wet fingers reduce accuracy.
Hint: increase hit areas to 44px, ensure text contrast meets AA.
Map view for entries (optional)

Rationale: visualize GPS points across the trip.
Hint: add a lightweight map tile (Leaflet or static images) showing pins from entries[].gps.
Accessibility: label hints and large-text mode

Rationale: easier reading in bright sun and for older eyes.
Hint: add a pref to enlarge fonts and expand spacing.
